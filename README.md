## ðŸ“‚ Projects
 
### 1. [NYC Yellow Taxi Data Project â€“ Microsoft Fabric](https://github.com/pratikshaprajapati/Data-Engineer-Projects/tree/main/Fabric-NYC-Taxi-Project)
> Built a complete data pipeline using Microsoft Fabric to ingest, transform, and visualize NYC Yellow Taxi trip data.  
> Tech stack: Lakehouse, Dataflows Gen2, Pipelines, Warehouse, Power BI
 
ðŸ“Œ **Key Outcomes**:
- Built end-to-end ELT pipelines from raw data to presentation layer
- Loaded ~1M+ records into Fabric Warehouse using Parquet & Delta formats
- Automated lookup, staging, and presentation layer flows with orchestration
- Created a Power BI dashboard to visualize trip trends, revenue, and more

### 2. [CICIDS2017 Network Traffic Data Pipeline â€“ Python]()
 
> Built a robust data engineering pipeline to process and analyze labeled network traffic data from the CICIDS2017 dataset for security insights and ML readiness.
Tech stack: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ”‘ **Key Outcomes:**
- Cleaned and processed 225K+ records with 85+ network traffic features
- Engineered custom security features like byte ratios and flow flags
- Visualized attack distribution, protocol trends, top attacker IPs, and feature correlations
- Exported final enriched dataset for downstream modeling and analytics
