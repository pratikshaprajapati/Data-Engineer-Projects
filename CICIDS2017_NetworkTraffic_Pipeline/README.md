## 🛡️ CICIDS2017 Network Traffic - Python Data Engineering Pipeline
 
This project demonstrates a data engineering pipeline built using the CICIDS2017 intrusion detection dataset. The goal is to simulate real-world handling of network traffic logs, clean and enrich the data, and prepare it for further analysis or machine learning.

## 📁 Project Structure
 
- `CICIDS2017_Data_Engineering_Pipeline.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with all preprocessing steps and visualizations.
- `data/raw/`: Contains the raw CSV file from CICIDS2017 (e.g., Friday-WorkingHours-Afternoon-DDos.csv).
- `data/processed/`: Cleaned and feature-rich CSV ready for modeling or dashboarding.
- `images/`: Optional — stores generated plots and charts.

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
 
1. **Data Wrangling**: Handled missing/null/infinite values.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Created features like byte ratios, flow duration, and packet counts.
3. **Security Insights**:
   - Label distribution chart
   - Top attacker IPs
   - Protocol usage patterns
   - Correlation heatmap of engineered features
4. **Export**: Final dataset exported for use in BI tools or ML models.
